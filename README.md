# Reinforcement Learning Environment
A Reinforcement Learning environment which is based on a sheep eating grass logic.   

### Quick Start Guide
From the cloned repository, run the following commands in the terminal:

$conda env create -f environment.yml   
$conda activate sheep_env

If using pycharm, set the interpreter to the python version in the created conda env e.g:

.../anaconda3/envs/sheep_env/bin/python

There are two ways to test the environment. Run the "suite_manual.py" file to test manually or run "suite_random.py" to test random behaviour.
